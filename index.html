                Carsten Höller is known for large-scale artworks that draw upon amusement parks, playgrounds and zoos. He seeks ways as an artist to transform common expectations of social spaces by altering perceptions and creating unexpected sensations - both physical and psychological. Höller applies his training as a scientist to his work as an artist, concentrating particularly on the nature of human relationships. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Promoting joy — or a feeling “somewhere between delight and madness” — was Höller’s purpose when he created Aventura Slide Tower. “The emotional state created by traveling down the slide is a unique condition and was once described by the French writer Roger Caillois as “ a kind of voluptuous panic upon an otherwise lucid mind,” he says. “The slide can be experienced both by sliding down it or by viewing it from the outside with people coming down in it — which are different, but both powerful, experiences.”

              THE HAAS BROTHERS, <br> Gorillas in the Mist
            </h1>

            <div class="text mb-md-5">
              <p>
                Twins Nikolai and Simon Haas draw upon their creative upbringing by an opera-signing mother, sculptor father and actor brother, who taught them to write, sign, paint and play music from an early age. Their art explores aesthetic and formal themes based upon nature, science fiction, color theory…even psychedelia. Their curiosity, visual perception and clever use of multiple mediums set their works apart from the everyday.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gorillas in the Mist is a unique public work designed expressly for Aventura Mall. A whimsical fountain comprised of three large-scale bronze gorillas, four massive bronze trees and five in hand carved marble benches. The piece functionally circulates water, creating a space that is both peaceful and evocative.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Gorillas in the Mist is a portrait of the people we most care about,” say the brothers. “Less specifically in terms of actual people, but more of the roles that certain people can play: a partner, a good friend and a child. It’s a fountain and a playground, built specifically with children in mind.” The Haas Brothers currently live and work in Los Angeles, California.¡

              <p>
                Mark Handforth (born in Hong Kong 1969) is a sculptor based in Miami, Florida. His work is collected by the Dallas Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Whitney Museum of American Art among others. From the basic form of a bent wire clothes hanger, Handforth obtains a freestanding sculpture that inscribes a calligraphically figurative sign into the space, without completely renouncing its representational origin.With Blackbird, Handforth addresses the economy of everyday office life: the wire clothes hanger stands as a symbol for the increasing abstraction of domestic life in the age of a capitalist primacy; managers’ accurately ironed shirts typically leave the laundry on these very same clothes hangers.

Inspired by a story of the artists’ creation, the playground is a magical dream world in which children discover Peekoo, the baby mountain, and his adventures with his new friend, Cloudy, in the magical Rainbow Valley.

Under the direction of renowned ceramicists Carlos Alves and JC Carroll, the young artists collaborated to bring to fruition a work of art that depicts the tropical and welcoming South Florida lifestyle. The unique project features hand-made mosaic tiles that embellish each step of the majestic stairwell through a colorful display of iconic Florida imagery.

                    Tom Otterness is one of America’s premier public artists. Otterness describes Tree of Knowledge as a “biblical/ judicial mix of story and image.” In this sculpture, the serpent of knowledge entwines a bronze tree. The serpent eyes an owl judge, while blind justice weighs two small human figures. A possum engrossed in a law book hangs upside-down, oblivious to the drama surrounding him.

The artist also experiments with light and animation techniques to create “walking portraits” that are installed in public environments and interact with viewers going about their daily routines. His artwork has been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions including the Shanghai Expo in China 2010.                  </p>

                  WENDELL CASTLE,<br> Veiled in a Dream

                    With Veiled in a Dream, Castle experimented with innovative techniques and a interest in bronze to create a sculpture that provides visitors with both an object to admire and a chair on which to sit. The piece reflects Castle’s fascination with re-defining the way design is viewed by exploring the silver of creative space he discovered between furniture and sculpture.

              <p>
                Considered one of the most revered artists of our time, Louise Bourgeois’s first exhibition of sculpture took place in New York in 1949 and she holds the distinction of being the first woman artist to be given a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her work is included in the collections of most of the world’s leading museums.

              <p>
                The surrealistic Eye Benches appear to follow viewers with their disembodied gaze. Bourgeois has said, “Whether it is an eye that sees the reality of things or whether it is an eye that sees a world of fantasy…It is the quality of your eyes and the strength of your eyes that are expressed here. Nobody is going to keep me from seeing what is instead of what I would like.”

                    Abstract and figural at the same time, the snowman provides a witty commentary on the state of sculpture, modernism, and Pop art. Hume has described the snowman as “the perfect sculpture, viewable from all sides, immaculate from all angles.” Back of a Snowman was exhibited at London’s Royal Academy, the Irish Museum of Art, Germany’s Kunsthaus Bregenz, and New York’s Battery Park City.                  </p>

                    Paris-based artist Claire Fontaine’s work is a collection of neon, video, sculpture, painting, and text that often represents her political viewpoints and existential thoughts. After lifting her name from a popular brand of school notebooks, Fontaine declared herself a “readymade artist,” and has been specializing in neo-conceptual works since 2004. She leans into her freshness and youth to represent her search for subjective emancipation. Fontaine’s whimsical sign reading Have Cake & Eat It suitably hangs in Aventura Mall’s Treats Food Hall, reminding visitors they can have it all.                </div>

              <p>
                Jaume Plensa’s work integrates a wide variety of materials and he is inspired by spoken and written texts. Letters created from stainless steel form the framework of the contemplative figure in this sculpture and literally create a vocabulary of the body. Seated upon a rock, Plensa’s universal man, which the artist based on himself, reflects upon the world around him and invites viewers to create their own meaning.

              <p>
                Inspired by Warhol’s art and life, Rob Pruitt created The Andy Monument as a tribute to the late artist. Pruitt’s sculpture adapts and transforms the familiar tradition of classical statuary. The figure is based on a combination of digital scanning of a live model and hand sculpting, its surface finished in chrome, mounted on a concrete pedestal. It depicts Warhol as a ghostly, silver presence; a potent cultural force of both artist ad self-created myth.                    </p>

                “Arrows and Flower”, is a collaborative work by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami and Louis Vuitton Men’s Artistic Director Virgil Abloh. The work was exhibited in TECHNICOLOR 2 at Gagosian Paris. Murakami’s iconic, smiling flower motif is merged with Abloh’s signature four-point arrow logo. The fusion of each artist’s trademark iconography signals two different worlds coming together - the resulting artwork achieves a vision made possible by collaboration.              </p>

                    Mother Nature has awoken. Beneath her gaze, lovers embrace and birds take flight. That’s the imagery of the 80-foot-long mural painted by the Miami-based artist Luis Valle. “Living here has definitely impacted my art,” he says of his vibrant, almost psychedelic piece, titled Te Ama la Pachamama. “I think growing up in a city with such vibrant colors has influenced my color palette as well. My work also tends to be a blend of styles and cultures, which is what I think Miami represents.”

                    Brian Butler takes local cues and reimagines them in new and modern context. “Paradise and Fries” is a lighthearted play on Florida’s wild tropical climate, positioned in the immediate context of a food hall. Flamingos flex for cheeseburgers, while a gator balances a frosty shake. In this piece flora and fauna are served with a side of fries.

                    Focused on native Florida fauna and flora, this mural also highlights several endangered species, such as the Miami bluebutterfly, Florida panther, Florida cone flower, and grasshopper sparrow. The title comes from a quote by Theodore Roosevelt, “Cherish these natural wonders, cherish the natural resources, cherish the history and romance as sacred heritage, for your children and your children’s children. Do not let selfish men or greedy interests skin your country of its beauty, its riches or its romance.”

                    Mother Nature has awoken. Beneath her gaze, lovers embrace and birds take flight. That’s the imagery of the 80-foot-long mural painted by the Miami-based artist Luis Valle. “Living here has definitely impacted my art,” he says of his vibrant, almost psychedelic piece, titled Te Ama la Pachamama. “I think growing up in a city with such vibrant colors has influenced my color palette as well. My work also tends to be a blend of styles and cultures, which is what I think Miami represents.”

                    Brian Butler takes local cues and reimagines them in new and modern context. “Paradise and Fries” is a lighthearted play on Florida’s wild tropical climate, positioned in the immediate context of a food hall. Flamingos flex for cheeseburgers, while a gator balances a frosty shake. In this piece flora and fauna are served with a side of fries.
